## Introduction

In this project, we are presenting a vignette on Random Forest. If you are new to this topic, then this vignette would be a great guideline for you to have a great understanding on Random forest model, and we will also show the sample code on a dataset to predict the edibility of mushrooms using Random Forest.

*Objectives:*

-   learn the algorithms behind Random Forest

    -   This includes decision trees, hyperparameters & tuning

-   Use R to fit a model with Random Forest Regression Model
