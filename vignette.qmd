## Introduction

> In this project, we are presenting a vignette on Random Forest. If you are new to this topic, then this vignette would be a great guideline for you to have a great understanding on Random forest model, and we will also show the sample code on a dataset to predict the edibility of mushrooms using Random Forest.

*Learning Objectives:*

-   learn the algorithms behind Random Forest

    -   This includes decision trees, hyperparameters & tuning

-   Implement Random Forest on a classification problem using R

Here we have a introductory video for you to better know what is Random Forest.

## Algorithm

#### What is Random Forest Algorithm?

> Random Forest Algorithm widespread popularity stems from its user-friendly nature and adaptability, enabling it to tackle both classification and regression problems effectively. The algorithm's strength lies in its ability to handle complex datasets and mitigate overfitting, making it a valuable tool for various predictive tasks in machine learning.

> One of the most important features of the Random Forest Algorithm is that it can handle the data set containing continuous variables, as in the case of regression, and **categorical variables**, as in the case of **classification**. It performs better for classification and regression tasks. In this tutorial, we will understand the working of random forest and implement random forest on a classification task.
